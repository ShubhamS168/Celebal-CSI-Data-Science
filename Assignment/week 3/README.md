# üèè IPL 2024 Dataset ‚Äì Data Cleaning & Visual Analytics
---

## üìò Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing match-wise performance metrics from the IPL 2024 season. The workflow covers:
- Parsing raw CSV data from Kaggle
- Extracting and formatting nested match fields (e.g., scores, overs)
- Producing a range of insightful visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

The objective is to help cricket analysts explore how players and teams performed across multiple dimensions, such as boundary counts, strike rates, venue efficiency, and powerplay metrics.

## üßπ Data Cleaning Pipeline

Executed via `cleaning_dataset.ipynb`, this notebook handled:
- JSON parsing (`runningScore` field)
- Type normalization for strike rate, overs, and boundaries
- Missing value management
- Clean dataset export to `IPL_cleaned_2024.csv`
