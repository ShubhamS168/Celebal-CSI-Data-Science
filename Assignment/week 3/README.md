# üèè IPL 2024 Dataset ‚Äì Data Cleaning & Visual Analytics

**Prepared by:** Shubham Sourav  
**Module:** Week 3 ‚Äì Data Analysis Assignment

---

## üìò Overview

This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing match-wise performance metrics from the IPL 2024 season. The workflow covers:
- Parsing raw CSV data from Kaggle
- Extracting and formatting nested match fields (e.g., scores, overs)
- Producing a range of insightful visualizations using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

The objective is to help cricket analysts explore how players and teams performed across multiple dimensions, such as boundary counts, strike rates, venue efficiency, and powerplay metrics.

## üßπ Data Cleaning Pipeline

Executed via `cleaning_dataset.ipynb`, the following tasks were performed:

- Converted `runningScore` JSON strings to dictionaries using `ast.literal_eval`
- Extracted key fields like `runs`, `wickets`, and cleaned `runningOver`
- Handled missing, malformed, or inconsistent entries
- Converted data types for fields like `ballsFaced`, `strikeRate`, and `runningOver`
- Exported final cleaned DataFrame to `IPL_cleaned_2024.csv` for further analysis

## üìà Visualizations Summary

The script `ipl2024_visualizations.py` generates insights categorized below. All charts are saved in the `visualizations/` folder automatically.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Project

### 1. Install Required Libraries
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

### 2. Execute the Visualization Script
Navigate to the folder containing `ipl2024_visualizations.py` and run:
```bash
python ipl2024_visualizations.py
```

Ensure `IPL_cleaned_2024.csv` is in the same directory. All outputs will be saved inside the `visualizations/` folder.
