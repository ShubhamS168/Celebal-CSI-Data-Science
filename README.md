## 📌 Weekly Assignments

### 🗓️ Week 1: Triangle Pattern Generator

**Objective:**  
Implement three different triangle pattern generators that take dynamic user input.

**Included Patterns:**
- 🔼 Upper Triangle
- 🔽 Lower Triangle
- 🔺 Pyramid

**Features:**
- Accepts user-defined height/size
- Clear console outputs for patterns
- Input validation and error handling
- Logs pattern output for verification or debugging

**To Run:**
```bash
cd Celebal-CSI-Data-Science/Assignment/week\ 1
python upper_triangle.py
```

### 🗓️ Week 2: Singly Linked List (Object-Oriented)

**Objective:**  
Create a basic implementation of a singly linked list using object-oriented programming in Python.

**Features:**
- Class-based design with `Node` and `LinkedList` classes
- Core methods:
  - `add_node(data)`
  - `print_list()`
  - `del_nth_node(n)`
- Uses Python `typing.Optional` for type hinting
- Strong input validation and exception handling
- Visual explanation with comments and ASCII diagrams

**To Run:**
```bash
cd Celebal-CSI-Data-Science/Assignment/week\ 2
python linked_list.py
```
